# DeepEntXAI

**DeepEntXAI: A CNN-LSTM + Explainable AI Framework for Predicting Drug Activity Against Enterobacteriaceae**

DeepEntXAI is a hybrid deep learning framework developed to predict the biological activity of chemical compounds against **Enterobacteriaceae** pathogens (e.g., *E. coli*, *K. pneumoniae*, *S. enterica*) using molecular descriptors. The framework combines a **CNN-LSTM** architecture with **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to achieve state-of-the-art prediction accuracy while ensuring model interpretability. It supports both labelled and unlabelled compound predictions and includes tools for compound prioritisation and descriptor relevance evaluation.

## 📌 Key Features

* **Hybrid Deep Learning Model**: Combines CNN and LSTM to capture both local and long-range dependencies in molecular descriptor sequences.
* **High Accuracy**: Achieved 99.80% accuracy, 99.63% precision, and 99.94% recall on test data.
* **Generalisation**: Demonstrated strong generalisation through 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation with average accuracies of 99.09% ± 0.36% and 99.13% ± 0.27%, respectively.
* **Explainability**: Integrates both:

  * A **hybrid perturbation-based XAI** method (accuracy drop, flip ratio, log-loss increase)
  * **LIME** for local interpretability and compound-specific insights.
* **Prediction on Unlabelled Data**: Scores new compounds (0–10 scale) to identify high-potential drug candidates.
* **Output-Ready Results**: Generates CSV files with prediction probabilities, scaled activity scores, and interpretability rankings.
